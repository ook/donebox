Restful Authentication Generator
====

This is a basic restful authentication generator for rails, taken from acts as authenticated.  Currently it requires Rails 1.2 (or edge).

To use:

  ./script/generate authenticated user sessions --include-activation

The first parameter specifies the model that gets created in signup (typically a user or account model).  A model with migration is created, as well as a basic controller with the create method.

The second parameter specifies the sessions controller name.  This is the controller that handles the actual login/logout function on the site.

The third parameter (--include-activation) generates the code for a ActionMailer and its respective Activation Code through email.

You can pass --skip-migration to skip the user migration.

From here, you will need to add the resource routes in config/routes.rb.  

  map.resources :users, :sessions

Also, add an observer to config/environment.rb if you chose the --include-activation option
  config.active_record.observers = :user_observer # or whatever you named your model
