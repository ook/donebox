donebox
=======

This application was written by Marc-Andr√© Cournoyer (the father of thin: http://code.macournoyer.com/).

I (Thomas Lecavelier) just upgrade it to rails 2.1.0 and plan to fix some strange behavior and add so feature.

Next?
=====

I plan to implement a full set of features, but only in a plugin way: donebox has to stay as light as it could, so admin install only what they want to propose, and users enable only features they want among the installed plugins.
